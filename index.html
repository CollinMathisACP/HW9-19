<h1>An Effective Chart</h1>

<p>
This chart compares the number of aircraft casualties per year (broken down into three categories) with the total amount of 
aircraft passengers from 1970 to 2012. While Cairo stated that having multiple y-axes can be a means of creating misleading 
charts, both of these axes start at zero and have uniform increments, and thus provide an accurate comparison. What makes this 
chart so effective as a means of data visualization is that the reader can quickly identify several points of interest. The 
first is the trend that aircraft casualties have decreased even as the total number of passengers has increased. Furthermore, 
there are additional opportunities for insight as one takes a closer look at each yearâ€™s statistics. The splitting of aircraft 
casualties into different categories allows the reader to identify years when particular incidents occurred. The most clear 
example is 2001, where the reader can instantly see the magnitude of the September 11th attacks in comparison to other years. 
On a purely visual level, the use of color reinforces the point of the chart. The use of red-scale colors for casualties is 
fitting, as red is commonly seen as an indicator of confrontation. The opposite is true of light blue, which is much more neutral. 
The end result is a chart that communicates insightful information on multiple different levels.

In this chart, the reader is treated to information regarding the distribution of a given variable among four possible values. 
The fact that they sum to 100% might make a pie chart appealing, but as Cairo explained in the reading, pie charts are rarely a 
good way of visualizing information. Furthermore, this one is a particularly egregious example. For no functional purpose, this 
pie chart is three-dimensional, and we look into it at a downward angle. This only serves to make it more difficult for the reader 
to discern the proportion that each pie slice takes up (something that hard under the best of circumstances.) This is compounded by 
a poor use of color, as none of the pie slices are visually striking. The end result is a pie chart that cannot be understood without 
the numbers being overlaid on the figure. This chart fails at its basic purpose.

<h1>How to Improve it<h1>
<p>
To improve the visualization of this data, we must first use a different chart design. Pie charts are severely flawed, and a 
bar chart would be better in this context. If possible the data should also be presented as raw totals rather than a percentage, 
as this would look better in the bar chart format. I do not actually understand the data well enough to know if that is feasible, 
but for now let us assume that it is. Once the data has been visualized in this form, the creative decisions regarding the chart 
itself would be the final steps in making it memorable. This could include a meaningful use of color if such a thing makes sense 
in the context of this data, as well as scaling the axes to highlight the differences between each category. If all of these things 
are done, the end result would be a graph that, while simple, would be an appealing and accurate representation of the data.
